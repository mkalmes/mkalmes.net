## Use your iPhone to keep an eye on your nursing.

When was the last time you nursed your child and which side was it again? NRSNG (pronounced "nursing") helps you to stay focused on your child. Just start NRSNG and the duration of the feeding will be shown on a huge display. After that, the time since the last feeding will be shown.

NRSNG

* doesn't need an internet connection,

* can be closed, and the timer still runs, and

* is ad-free.
